                This web archive juxtaposes images 
                of the countercultural collective, Vocations for Social Change, with contemporary Google Maps searches 
                of the addresses found in their directory. The collective once 
                relied on the directory to organize their close-knit community and disseminate their ideology. When 
                the directory fell out of use, so 
                did the collective, marking the decline of their movement.
                
                By pairing historical imagery with current digital representations of these locations, the archive reflects 
                the physical and societal changes brought about by the loss of the directory. It prompts us to consider not
                only how digital platforms have redefined access and privacy but also the tangible consequences for spaces 
                once defined by collective action. This project highlights what we lose and what we gain as we transition 
                from analog to digital networks.
