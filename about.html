                This web archive juxtaposes images<br>of the countercultural collective,<br>
                Vocations for Social Change, with<br>
                contemporary Google Maps searches<br>of the addresses found in their<br>
                directory. The collective once<br>relied on the directory to organize<br>
                their close-knit community and<br>disseminate
                their ideology. When<br>the directory fell out of use, so<br>
                did the collective, marking the<br>decline of their
                movement. <br>
                <br>
                By pairing historical imagery with<br>current digital representations of<br>
                these locations, the archive reflects<br>the physical and societal changes<br>
                brought about by the loss of the<br>directory. It prompts us to consider<br>
                not only how digital platforms have<br>redefined access and privacy but also<br>
                the tangible consequences for spaces<br>once defined by collective action.<br>
                This project highlights what we lose<br>and what we gain as we transition from<br>
                analog to digital networks.
